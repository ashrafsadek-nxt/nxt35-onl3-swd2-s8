        <br>
        <p class="p">
            The job of a computer programmer is one of the important jobs now and in the future as well. The primary task of computer programmers is to create the codes that tell the computer what it should do. This profession is divided into two areas: systems programmers and application programmers.
            So that system programmers put the codes in the main system of the computer, while the application programmers work with one type of software or computer applications and put the codes for them, and it is very rare to find one programmer who specializes in both types of programming, as each They are familiar with very different skills, but programmers in both types of computer programming must have the main skills in writing and computer repairs.
           In order for a person to work as a computer programmer, he must have a bachelor‚Äôs degree, and he can have additional options, such as taking lessons in basic and advanced programming, and a number of technical computer science lessons, in addition to systems engineering, in addition to obtaining important and basic courses in computer such as special skills Using the keyboard and the computer, although this is not necessary but it is better if it is obtained, then the programmer will be able to perform his job with full skill, and unparalleled performance.
           Finally, it must be known that the responsibilities of computer programmers are the same as those of any employee in any other profession, as he must come to work at a certain time, do his work as required of him, and listen to the orders of his boss at work.

        <br>
        <p  class="p">
            Computer programmers are the ones who develop programs that computers use in order to perform their functions, so that the programmer works to follow the specifications given to him by computer software engineers, but it must be noted that in order for a person to work as a computer programmer, he must first obtain a bachelor‚Äôs degree, This is generally in computer science, mathematics or information systems, and some computer programmers can also take courses in computer science during their degrees in accounting, finance and business.
            As a student, I would very much like to one day become a computer programmer, as programming skills and experience are greatly appreciated in those areas, especially knowledge of languages and some object-oriented tools. Keeping abreast of constant technology changes.
            After they gain fluent experience, computer programmers may be promoted to some management position, a person with business experience may turn into a programmer or systems analyst, and specialized knowledge and experience in language or operating systems may lead computer programmers to become engineers. Computer programs.
            In conclusion I want to become a computer programmer because I love designing games very much, I love playing video games and I want to learn how to code for the things I love, I already know a lot about programming and I want to learn more and more every day
