Every day, I wake up at 7 o’clock in the morning. I brush my teeth and take a quick shower. Then, I eat breakfast and get ready for school. I usually leave my house at 8 o’clock. At school, I study many subjects like English, Math, and Science. I come back home at 3 p.m. After that, I eat lunch and take a short rest. In the evening, I do my homework and sometimes watch TV. I usually go to bed at 10 p.m. This is my simple daily routine.
